Many DIY-ers may not give a Rat's Butt about building codes, compliance with anything, or insurance. Yet, there are some valid reasons for caring: 

* Following building codes may be required and/or open doors for you in certain locations. If you need building inspections or permits, building code are likely part of your project. 
* EPA compliance may be required in some locations. EPA-friendly = environment friendly, so there's a reason to care. 
* Insurance company policies vary by company, location, and broker. If you don't need insurance, move on. If you do, following building codes or at least using common sense along with well known wood stove installation practices could save you money.
