What is this? 
==========================

While there's a treasure trove of detail in the community forums and floating around the internet,  complete details or a comprehensive treatment of any topic are at bet elusive, and at worst, impossible to find. Who are the experts? What's been tested? How does one craft their personal Super Perfect Rocket Stove while adhering to best practices?  Consider the pages here as *seeds* whose value is directly proportional to contributions from dedicated DIY-ers (you). The data-driven pages in particular provide a platform for advancing the technology. It's certainly true that research is challenging and and even daunting for anyone looking to use thermosiphons, fan-driven combustion air, fluidized bed, downdraft systems, and so on. Even mundane tasks such as selecting DIY materials or viewing glass is a tedious chore. It should be easy. If it wasn't for Rocketeers like Peter van den Berg and others, we'd be in the Stone Age. But even in this Stove Age, DIY. . . seems like an impossible dream and tilting at windmills. 

Goals
-------------------

* **Support DIY development**: help designers make better decisions through faster access to information
* **Promote clean burning technology**: Encourage adoption of efficient biomass combustion devices; save time, money, Earth's resources
* **Advance the technology**: Despite the amazing advances over the last decade, there's much more to do: more tested and open source plans, optimized designs, TEG driven systems, tested and save thermosiphon systems, DIY materials, and <*insert long list here*>.

About the author
=====================

I work at Adobe as a technical writer and information architect. As a closet Pyro and Irredeemable DIY-er, I have the pleasure and torture of believing my Big Ideas are worth pursuing. However, my quest has been challenged by a Jungle of tangled details as well as deserts of scant detail. . . . internet

If there's public participation on these pages, then my role here will simply be that of *content manager*,  and the user-driven content will evolve organically. I've kicked started the effort, but without user-provided data, the effort will likely stall. 

This site cannot and should not replace any forum. The XXX and XXX forums are home to experts, experimenters, and hopeless Rocket Stove dreamers. Go there to ask questions. Come there is you want to add data or contribute to the documents here.
