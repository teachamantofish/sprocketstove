If you're lucky, you're not obsessed. Just download Peter van den Berg's free and `open source batch rocket plans <https://batchrocket.eu/en/>`_ and charge ahead. Nothing to see here. . . just move along and save yourself both time and money.

What is this? 
==========================

This document is a concise collection of ideas, data, and tools. 

While there's a treasure trove of detail in the community forums and  the internet, a comprehensive treatment of many topics are at best elusive, and at worst, impossible to find. Often, "how", "what", "why" are simply missing. But you have a nice photo. 

How does one craft their personal Super Perfect Rocket Stove using best practices and DIY-friendly materials?  Even mundane tasks such as selecting design, size, materials or viewing glass is a tedious chore. It should be easy. If it wasn't for Rocketeers like Peter van den Berg and others, we'd be in the Stone Age. But even in this Stove Age, DIY rockets can seem like an impossible dream. There's a wide spectrum of possiblities between merely functional and cutting edge. The adventure provides ample opportunities for tilting at the wrong windmill. 

Consider the pages here as *seeds* whose value is directly proportional to contributions from avid Rocketeers. The data-driven pages in particular provide a platform for advancing the technology. With luck, this site might streamline research for those looking to use thermosiphons, fan-driven combustion air, fluidized beds, downdraft systems, and so on. 

What this isn't 
-------------------------

This document is not: 

* A book
* A forum 
* A detailed explanation of things like construction techniques and designs (like you'll find in books and forums). 
* Selling anything

Goals
-------------------

* **Support DIY development**: help designers make better decisions through faster access to information
* **Promote clean burning technology**: Encourage adoption of efficient biomass combustion devices; save time, money, Earth's resources
* **Advance the technology**: Despite the amazing advances over the last decade, there's much more to do: more tested and open source plans, optimized designs, TEG driven systems, tested and save thermosiphon systems, DIY materials, and <*insert long list here*>.

Contribute
=========================

* Phase 1: Send me any info, link, or informational tidbit. I'll incorporate what seems reasonable. 
* Phase 2: I'll collect contributors and make the content open source to a select few via Github. 
* Phase 3: TBD

About the author
=====================

I'm a technical writer and information architect at at Adobe (PDF-photoshop Adobe . . . ). As a Closet Pyro and Irredeemable DIY-er, I have the pleasure and pain of believing my Big Ideas are worth pursuing.

If there's public participation on these pages, then my role here will simply be that of *content manager*,  and the user-driven content will evolve organically.
