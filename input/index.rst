Support and contacts
==========================

The Acrobat Developer Support team supports software development with the Acrobat DC SDKâ€™s core APIs. Developers can purchase support via the `Adobe Creative Cloud Exchange Developer Support program <https://helpx.adobe.com/ie/support/programs/cc-exchange-developer-support.html>`_. Supported SDK development activities include those for which the product is designed, tested, and licensed. Acrobat Developer Support does not support use cases that do not involve the Acrobat core API. 

Only the last two major SDK versions with interim updates are eligible for support. 

.. note:: For non-programmatic issues, such as questions about installing, using, customizing, or deploying Acrobat, contact `Acrobat Technical Support <https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/contact/what-contact-options.html>`_.
