This slideshow from EPA pg 11 shows that wood combustion requires about:

1100 to 1500 F temperature
Air ratio of 10-12 : 1 air weight to fuel weight
Residence of 204 seconds in high temperature zone
No flame contact with cold surfaces that quench the flame

12 lbs per pound would mean that a wood stove that burned 40 LB of wood in 2 hours would produce about 125,000 BTU per hour, and would burn up 0.33 LBs of wood per minute, needing about 49.4 say 50 CFM of combustion air. YMMV depending on wood species, moisture, and the usual other variables.

A bigger furnace that burned 75 LB of wood in 2 hrs would require 92.5 say 100 CFM of combustion air and produce roughly 235,000 BTU/Hr.

Thus a really small fan should be enough to supply the combustion air. These fans have little static pressure capacity, so generous ductwork would be needed to keep the static pressure under the spec of 0.26 inches W.C. This fan is more expensive but should handle more pressure

Preheated combustion air is a lot more important that I realized, since temperatures under 1100F will put out the flame. My own experiments with a heat gun also showed this - there was clearly a lot more secondary combustion observable when the heat gun was set on "10" and provided hot secondary air, rather than set on "0". Of course in a real stove one would never use electrically preheated combustion air, this was just an experiment. But an outdoor wood furnace could potentially be sucking in flame-robbing cold air below zero - it isn't just the BTUs required to heat the air, heated air helps the flame stay hot. That is really interesting.
